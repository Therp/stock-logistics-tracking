This module allows to generate SSCC codes for packages automatically.

SSCC codes are explained here: https://www.gs1.org/standards/id-keys/sscc

Typically, a company registers a range of 1000, 10000 or more SSCC codes which
they can then use as barcodes on their packages. These are unique, and once
they run out, new ones are bought.

With this module, you can modify Odoo's package number sequence to pick SSCC
codes from your range, instead of using the standard PACK00001, PACK00002 etc.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

* Identify your SSCC range. For example: `123456789012xxxxx`.
* Go to the form view of the `ir.sequence` record for your packages.
* Clear the Prefix field (eg from `PACK` to empty)
* Set the Sequence Size (padding) field to the number of variable digits.
  In the above example, it would be 5.
* Go to the Python tab
* Enable the 'Use Python' checkbox
* Change the default 'number' expression to:

.. code-block:: python

   # Note that you have to adapt this to your own range.
   "123456789012" + number_padded + str(get_barcode_check_digit("123456789012" + number_padded + "x"))

Now, your packages will generate with SSCC codes instead of regular sequence numbers such as PACK00001.
Once the numbers run out, you'll have to configure this again with a new sequence.
